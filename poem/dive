I went in head first
Yeah, I took a dive

To the depths of insanity
But somehow survived

Voices call out to me
No way to pretend

They won't let me be
They scream with no end

Fueling my anger
Fueling my fears

Of the demon inside me
And the hell that is near

Stripped of my dignity
They've taken my pride

Leaving me naked
And hollow inside

My gut is aching
To confess this sin

First came guilt
Then paranoia set in

Who to run to?
In whom to confide?

Who will forgive me?
For they know I have lied

I went in head first
Yeah, I took a dive

Into my Lord's arms
By his grace I survived
